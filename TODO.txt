- search songs and create rules
- generate and display playlist
- delete rules/songs from the playlist
- tons of keyboard shortcuts and section selector
- only queue what's needed for shuffle and albumshuffle, and queue per song for others
    - now it will queue all matching songs (and paths), but that's too much
