- improve lyrics
    - make ctrl-f4 open a text editor for the lyrics
    - have a search box to do a custom search on the genius api
    - try to strip featuring artists as an attempt to fetch lyrics better
    - after having an in-app editor and search, maybe add an option to skip genius
- make scrollBy actions for inputs use the container height instead of fixed high values
