- make ctrl tab switch between playlist and search section
- page jumping: page up/down
- top and bottom of sections: home, end
- scrolling: ctrl-e, ctrl-y
- playlist p: toggle between current and selection
- playlist c: move selection to current
- allow manual selection/override of lyrics, both custom or from result list
- double check if deletion always updates counters and works, it seems buggy
- implement fullscreen interface with large cover art
- add options to change the playlist VIEW automatically, such as:
    - auto scroll current
    - auto delete older than x
    - auto close rules that are not playing
- refactor keyboard input file
    - fix key holding not working when textarea is focused
    - remove repetition in the code with large amount for queries and returns
